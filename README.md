# Assignment

This Project is part of my 2nd Year Data Structure & Algorithms 2 module.
Is features a Cell Analyser in JavaFx.

# Uses
It allows the user to upload an image using FileChooser.
The user can process the image to show the red blood cells with a count and discern from the white blood cells.

The process of changing the image uses an Union Find algorithm to identify colour of similarity, thereby converting the image.
